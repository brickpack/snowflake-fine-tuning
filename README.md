### Script Status Summary

**Production Ready (11 scripts)**:

All scripts are fully functional, tested with MFA-enabled accounts, and include:
- Key-pair authentication support
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rich formatted output
- Case-insensitive column handling
- Decimal-to-float type conversions

**Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**:

Terraform modules are available for:
- Warehouse provisioning and configuration
- Database and schema management
- Role-based access control setup
- Cost monitoring and governance tagging

See the [terraform/](terraform/) directory for detailed implementation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Snowflake account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform 1.0+ (for IaC components)
- Access to Snowflake account usage and information schema

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd snowflake-fine-tuning

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Snowflake credentials
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Snowflake connection details:

```bash
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account.region
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=ACCOUNTADMIN
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=COMPUTE_WH
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=ANALYTICS
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=PUBLIC

# Authentication Method (choose one):

# Option 1: Key-Pair Authentication (recommended for automation, bypasses MFA)
SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/snowflake_rsa_key.p8
# SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase  # Optional

# Option 2: Password Authentication (requires interactive MFA if enabled)
# SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password

# Option 3: Browser-based SSO (supports MFA, interactive)
# SNOWFLAKE_AUTHENTICATOR=externalbrowser
```

#### Setting Up Key-Pair Authentication (Recommended)

For automated scripts and MFA-enabled accounts, use key-pair authentication:

```bash
# 1. Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_rsa_key.pem 2048

# 2. Generate public key
openssl rsa -in snowflake_rsa_key.pem -pubout -out snowflake_rsa_key.pub

# 3. Convert to PKCS8 format (required by Snowflake Python connector)
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in snowflake_rsa_key.pem -out snowflake_rsa_key.p8 -nocrypt

# 4. Get the public key value (without headers/footers)
cat snowflake_rsa_key.pub | grep -v "BEGIN PUBLIC" | grep -v "END PUBLIC" | tr -d '\n'

# 5. Add public key to your Snowflake user
# In Snowflake SQL:
ALTER USER your_username SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A...';

# 6. Set the path in your .env file
echo "SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=$(pwd)/snowflake_rsa_key.p8" >> .env
```

## Available Scripts

All scripts in this repository are production-ready and tested with MFA-enabled Snowflake accounts using key-pair authentication.

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Methods

This toolkit supports three authentication methods:

1. **Key-Pair Authentication (Recommended)**
   - Bypasses MFA for automated scripts
   - Uses RSA private/public key pairs
   - Most secure for automation workflows
   - Required for scripts running in CI/CD pipelines

2. **Password Authentication**
   - Simple username/password
   - Requires interactive MFA if enabled on account
   - Not suitable for automation

3. **Browser-based SSO**
   - OAuth/SSO via browser
   - Supports MFA through SSO provider
   - Interactive only (opens browser window)

### Architecture

All scripts follow a consistent architecture:

- **Connection Management**: Centralized connection handling via `snowflake_utils.py`
- **Query Execution**: Automatic connection pooling and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- **Output Formatting**: Rich console output using the `rich` library
- **Data Processing**: Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation

### Database Views Used

Scripts query the following Snowflake metadata views:

- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`: Query execution history
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`: Credit consumption
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_ROLES`: Role privileges
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.GRANTS_TO_USERS`: User role assignments
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY`: User authentication logs
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`: Table metadata
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.WAREHOUSES`: Warehouse configurations

**Note**: Account usage views have a latency of 45 minutes to 3 hours. Recent data may not appear immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. MFA Authentication Errors

**Error**: `250001 (08001): Failed to authenticate: MFA with TOTP is required`

**Solution**: Use key-pair authentication instead of password authentication. See the [Setting Up Key-Pair Authentication](#setting-up-key-pair-authentication-recommended) section above.

#### 2. Object Not Found or Not Authorized

**Error**: `002003 (42S02): Object 'SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSES' does not exist or not authorized`

**Solution**:
- Ensure your role has access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema
- Use `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or grant `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` on `SNOWFLAKE` database to your role:
  ```sql
  GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE your_role;
  ```

#### 3. Empty Results

**Issue**: Scripts return empty results or "No data found"

**Causes**:
- Account usage views have 45-minute to 3-hour latency
- Insufficient historical data (try increasing lookback period)
- Warehouse has not been used recently

**Solution**: Wait for data to populate or adjust the time range in queries.

#### 4. Type Conversion Errors

**Error**: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'`

**Solution**: This has been fixed in all scripts. If you encounter this, ensure you're using the latest version and that `snowflake_utils.py` includes proper Decimal-to-float conversions.

#### 5. Column Name Case Sensitivity

**Error**: `KeyError: 'column_name'` or `KeyError: 'COLUMN_NAME'`

**Solution**: Snowflake returns column names in UPPERCASE. All scripts now handle case-insensitive column access. If you encounter this, check that helper functions like `get_val()` are being used.
